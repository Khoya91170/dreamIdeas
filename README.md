# The dreamIdeas project
This project is a practical work on the Zend framework 2 I had to do during my BS degree with two comrades.

# The goal
The principle of this project is to develop a community website where people can share ideas, vote for them or exclude them after a certain time.

Ideas can be classified in groups according to the area concerned.
There must be an authentication system (registration / log in) to share ideas and vote for them.
It is important that ideas are associated with groups or communities.

# Results
Unfortunately, considering the different courses in our BS degree, we didn't have time to finish this practical work or even deal with Zend Framework 2 in depth which is really a good framework.
This framework imposed the use of MVC (that is an architectural pattern) which is very useful to separate the different layers of an application.
